**The IPL Analysis Project likely involves the following tools and technologies:

Power BI – For interactive dashboards and data visualization (since your file is a .pbix file, which is used in Power BI).

SQL – To query and manipulate IPL datasets efficiently.

Excel/CSV – For storing and preprocessing raw IPL data.

PostgreSQL - used as Backend
